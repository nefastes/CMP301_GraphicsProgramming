		-Where does the mainpulation happen?
		-What is the manipulated model/mesh?
		-What are the inputs and their structure?
		-What steps and/or formulas are used?
		-What paramenters are involved? (Explain them: Where do theu come from? What happens when you change them and why?)
		-What is the ouput
		-How do you calculate normals? Why is this the correct way to do it?
	->Include screenshots and diagrams
	->See slides for good example of this.
