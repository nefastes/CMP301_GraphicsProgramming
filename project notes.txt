New coursework plan:
	- finish tessellated plane with heightmap
	- do a simple post processing bloom
	- grass instanced on the geometry shader (not manipulated)
	- do a wooblely bubble
	- cascaded shadow maps
	- enhanced bloom
	- bubble gun/cannon

Bloom:
	- have a treshold value (0.7)
	- average the RGB components: if above the treshold write to render target, else write black
	- blur the render target
	- add the render target on top of the final render (do not saturate)
	- more efficient bloom will use the idea of luminence (multiply rgba with some matrix to get luminence)

For second semester in my own time:
	- ray tracing in one weekend
	- learn directX 12 basics, get started (if done, you will be able to use it for your honours project)
	- read ray tracing gems
