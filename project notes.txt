New coursework plan:
	V finish tessellated plane with heightmap (could optmise dynamically assign GPU memory (can send less useless empty marices))
	V do a simple post processing bloom (gloom?) OR dynamic cube maps???
	X grass instanced on the geometry shader (not manipulated) -> Sadly didn't have time for it ):
	V generate TerrainMesh with a translation and scale
	- rewrite blur compute shader
	- clean code
	- soft shadows

For second semester in my own time:
	- ray tracing in one weekend
	- learn directX 12 basics, get started (if done, you will be able to use it for your honours project)
	- read ray tracing gems
